    	After researching laptops before their first years of college, the creators of TechDB, Alec Borer and Jacob
    Medici, were frustrated by a lack of consistency of laptop and other peripherals in their specifications. This
    is what inspired TechDB. In its current state, TechDB is a young database that is already making great steps in
    achieving its goal of enforcing accurate specifications of products and spreading quality information about
    technology.
	    TechDB currently allows every user to create posts and search for articles and technologies. Users who are
    designated as manufacturers are able to add items and their specifications and administrators are able to
    remove entries. Users can edit posts to correct misinformation and keep each other in check. The website
    can be used by guests who have all the capabilities of account creators (currently), but donâ€™t have the
    same presence as users who create real and secure accounts.
        The creators of TechDB made the decision not to complete the implementation of favoriting items as it
    did not prove useful to the first round of users; however, a significant majority of the backend
    implementation of favoriting can be found in the Github repository.
